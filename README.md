*👋🏼 Hey there, I'm Sandy!* 

After 12+ years in customer service and nearly a decade in healthcare, I made the leap into tech to pursue my passion for problem solving and building meaningful systems. Since 2020, I’ve been developing backend applications with a focus on test-driven development (`TDD`), secure authentication, and API integration primarily using `Ruby on Rails`, `Elixir`, and `PostgreSQL`.

I'm currently open to new opportunities (especially remote roles or positions in the UK with visa sponsorship) and actively working on side projects, including game development in `Unity` and fullstack certifications to broaden my technical toolkit with projects covering `React`, `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me deep in a video game or exploring new tools that stretch my creativity. I’m always learning, always building, and always looking for ways to make tech more impactful.

📌 Follow along to see what I’m working on next!
